    * Measure a page’s perceived performance
    * Collect browser WebTiming information
    * Measure perceived performance of content loaded dynamically
    * Measure a user’s bandwidth along with page load time
    * Measure HTTP latency
    * Request/page tagging
    * Measure DNS latency
    * Measure a random sample of users instead of all users

  The following web browsers are currently supported :
   * IE9+
   * Chrome
   * Firefox 7+

* **Deep Dive into your application source code**

## Integration

The integration of Lead Wire in your application is completely transparent, you do not have to change a single line of code.
The only thing you have to do is to place the agent with your application and integrate it into your startup script.

The integration is as simple as adding the following to the startup of your application.

` -javaagent:[LEADWIRE_HOME]/leadwire-agent.jar -Dleadwire.agent.name=[AGENT_NAME] `

## Eclipse Setup for Developers
1. Get Gradle support by installing the Eclipse plugin "Buildship: ..." in version 2 or above.
1. If you have already imported leadwire-javaagent in Eclipse, delete it
1. Use git to clone leadwire-javaagent from the web url :  https://github.com/leadwire-apm/leadwire-javaagent.git
1. In Eclipse, right click button on the project, then "Configure" -> "Add Gradle nature"
1. Whenever you change a build.gradle file, regenerate the .project and .classpath files for Eclipse by using "Gradle->Refresh Gradle Project"
