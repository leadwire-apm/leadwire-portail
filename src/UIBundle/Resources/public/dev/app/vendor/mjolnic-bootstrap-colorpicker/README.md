## Download
For getting the source code, you have many options:

- [Download](https://github.com/mjolnic/bootstrap-colorpicker/archive/master.zip) the source code
- Clone it: `git clone https://github.com/mjolnic/bootstrap-colorpicker.git`
- Install it through [Bower](http://bower.io): `bower install mjolnic-bootstrap-colorpicker`

## Reporting
- For reporting issues, please provide an example using JSFiddle or similar to reproduce the issue.

## Contributing
- If you want to develop or fix the plugin, run `npm install` and `bower install` inside the plugin folder, to get the needed dependencies.
- Do not modify dist files directly (they are autogenerated using grunt tasks) and don't forget to run `grunt` inside the plugin folder before commiting and requesting PRs. It is needed for regenerating the minified files. Pull Requests without updated minified files won't be accepted.
- Check that the index.html demos aren't broken (modify if necessary).
- Test your code at least in Chrome, Firefox and IE >= 10.

Thanks =)
